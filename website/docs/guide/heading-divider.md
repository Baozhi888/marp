# Heading divider

### This is a stub page!

By using heading divider, you can indicate to split pages at before headings whose specified level. It's useful when converting an existing Markdown document to the slides.

This is similar to [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)'s [`--slide-level` option](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#structuring-the-slide-show) and [Deckset 2](https://www.deckset.com/2/)'s "Slide Dividers" option.

> This feature is inherited from [Marpit framework](https://marpit.marp.app/directives?id=heading-divider).
