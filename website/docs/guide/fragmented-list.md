# Fragmented list

### This is a stub page!

Fragmented list (also known as incremental list, build animation)

## Limitation

- Fragmented list is only available in the exported HTML. PDF and PPTX will not reproduce animation.

> The syntax is inherited from [Marpit framework](https://marpit.marp.app/fragmented-list), and the animation is reproduced by [Marp CLI](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli)'s default HTML template `bespoke`.
